                    <h2> The most common cause of World Hunger is due to poverty. Individuals who face poverty can not afford to buy enough food, and can not afford to buy nutrious foods for their family. In fact, this becomes an ongoing cycle as a person can not advance economically because they are extremely malnourished as a result of a significant lack of food. Wars are another contributor to world hunger. As resources become scarce during this time, prices for items, such as food, begin to rise enourmously. Consequently, families now struggle to afford these pricey foods and individuals who were farmers, have abonded their lands to escape the war. Other contributors to world hunger include food shortages, climate change, a country's poor economy, food waste, forced migrations, gender inequalities, and poor nutrition.</h2>
